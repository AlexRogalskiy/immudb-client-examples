# immudb Client Examples

This Git repository is a central repository for examples using official immudb clients in different languages.

- Go https://docs.immudb.io/immudb/golang.html
- Java https://github.com/codenotary/immudb4j
- Python https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-py
- Node.js https://github.com/codenotary/immudb-node

We're actively working on the implementation of immudb clients for different languages.

The most complete client is implemented in Golang, and it's used to build immuclient and immuadmin CLIs.


immudb can easily be used from any language by means of [immugw].
